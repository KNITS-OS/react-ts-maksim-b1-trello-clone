**This follows the \newline book (r4) [Maksim Ivanov: Fullstack React with TypeScript](https://gumroad.com/d/8dbdf6a00eea7f97e565e7c4ca4b518c)**

* got stuck in step7: since introducing the customs view of the dragged item, the whole dragging stopped working.

* got stuck in step8: the communication with the backend wouldn't work because of inconsitensies with types, return values concerning the useEffect() hook.

* [online help](https://discord.com/channels/621709887231229970/718538083959832608) isn't that great at all

App is currently set to step9, backend and dragging works. Paused, while waiting for updated version of the book.
